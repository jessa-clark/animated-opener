# animated-opener

Practicing some animations for hero's image. Followed this tutorial on YouTube https://youtu.be/-r2axaJUaP8.

I ran into a few issues with #box1:after. The after image appeared with the before image. I tried to debug this several times but couldn't get it quite right. Decided to call it a night and a different tutorial another day.

I had a lot of fun learning this animation. Many thanks to Daft Creation for doing this walkthrough!
